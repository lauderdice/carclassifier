# Neural network car classifier

This application is a Flask (https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) app serving as a classifier for car images. It provides an interface to a Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org) model that predicts the carmaker of the car on the submitted image.

The app is structured as both a template-based Flask application and an API which could be used completely independently. 

The "frontend" directory contains a plain Javascript frontend which uses the Flask API but currently it is not yet implemented completely.
